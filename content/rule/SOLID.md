Five principles for object-oriented programming:
- **S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – Each class should have one responsibility or reason to change.
- **O: Open/Closed Principle** – Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L: Liskov Substitution Principle** – Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **I: Interface Segregation Principle** – Use small, specific interfaces instead of a large, general-purpose one.
- **D: Dependency Inversion Principle** – High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
